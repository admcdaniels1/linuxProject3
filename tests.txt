Project 4

We tested numerous blank files/missing files for all three scripts. We also
tested how well the scripts ran with odd values in the fields and data. Blank
didn't affect print, however impossible to enter blank lines into insert. 
Delete ignores them. Calling print with any number of arugments works, however
if a fieldname is specified that doesn't exist it throws an error. 
Both "./print CS492 -r -r field" and "./print CS492 -n -n field" work because
sort can handle being based those duplicated flags. Insert requires that you 
enter the same number of values as there are fields, none can be left blank.
Delete will not delete based on field total for spreadsheets, however works
fine for databases.
